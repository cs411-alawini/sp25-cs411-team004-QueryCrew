## Project Summary

RentHubDB provides a seamless solution for car rental companies to oversee their vehicle inventory, manage reservations, and analyze customer preferences. There are several features that enable businesses to make data-driven decisions when monitoring vehicle usage, identifying rental trends, and adjusting inventory across location as well as pricing based on demand. For example, an interactive heat map highlights popular rental locations, which is useful information for the business to store cars in their garages and optimize pricing. 

	In addition to rental car administrators, customers can also benefit from using the RentHubDB platform. For customers, this application offers a smooth and easy experience when searching for and booking rental cars. Whether they’re looking for a specific model, price range, or location, they can easily find options that match their needs. The system updates availability in real time, so customers always have up-to-date information. By focusing on small and mid-sized rental businesses that don’t have access to advanced tracking tools, RentHubDB fills a major gap in the industry, offering a practical and efficient way to manage both inventory and customer experience.
